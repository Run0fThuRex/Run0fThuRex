### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my education for programming and cybersecurity. Still very early on and would very much be open to any guidance or advice given to me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fundamentals of basic programming and same early novice levels of cybersecurity thanks to the resources from freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, HackTheBox, and in the near future, San Antonio College.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that I would be given the opportunity of working on with anyone. I would love a chance to work with others and be able to finally get some experience and learn to see what I can do and help with.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding some sort of more specific guidance and path to what I'd like to do with my education and where I'd like to choose my career path to go into.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you'd like to know about me.
