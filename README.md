# üí´ About Me:
-Currently working on: Starting a career in software development or web development.<br><br>-Looking to collaborate on: Any project or opportunity possible as it'll be my first collaboration as well as my first real project!<br><br>-Looking for help with: Quite frankly, everything. I'd really love someone who has experience to be able to somewhat mentor me or guide me in the right direction, as far as career guidance and what I should be doing as someone who is doing this all self-taught with no prior professional experience or formal education past a G.E.D.<br><br>-Currently learning: Web development using FCC as well as Codecademy, additionally learning Machine Learning and AI data science(still consider myself new to the later mentioned)<br><br>-Ask me about: Anything anyone would like to know about me!<br><br>-Fun fact: My professional work history consists of nothing other than Construction and factory jobs! I have always had a passion for technology and only recently(roughly a year ago) began pursuing a career in the computer science industry, due to my desire for a career I would find genuine passion and joy in, as well as hopefully better pay than labor positions. I'm doing this 100% self-taught with no college education or anything!
